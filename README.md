# Bamazon
with the Bamazon app the first portion will have a customer select an item from the menu. 
The Bamazon database will hold the item ID, name of product, department name, price, and quantity.
Once the customer selects an item the program will prompt how many of the item the customer wants.
The system will check the database to see if there is enough stock, if there isn't the user will be notified there isn't, otherwise the app will let the customer know how much the total of the selected item will be with the quantity chosen.
